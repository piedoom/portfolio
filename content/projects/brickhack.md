BrickHack brings designers, developers, and all sorts of makers together for 24 hours to create something from nothing.  It's RIT's premiere hackathon, and you're invited!  (Or at least you would have been in 2016).

# Building on other work

I started working with the BrickHack team when BrickHack 2 was starting up.  That meant that I had previous branding to incorporate.  Here's what the older logo (created by someone else) looked like, along with my *New and Improved* version on the right / below.  My goal was to keep the recognizable brand while creating something a bit more friendly looking.

This newer logo was also used on T-Shirts, banners, and many other fixtures. BrickHack also retained the new overall look and aesthetic for their 3rd and 4th hackathons.  Images below are credit of MLH and Fedora respectively.
