# USA TODAY

In 2017, our class was fortunate enough to have a few USA TODAY design members to propose a project.  

{{ key(title="Problem") }}

We were presented a problem: Millenials didn't engage enough with USA TODAY content.  Our job was to fix that.  I teamed up with my friend and colleage [Darrin](https://dbl3895.cias.rit.edu/) and we began to describe what makes news apps appeal to Millenials.

1. Applications should promote experiences, especially shared ones.  
2. Content must be concise and understandable
3. UI/UX should be quick and lightweight

With these factors in mind, we proceeded to brainstorm and talk.
