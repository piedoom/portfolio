I keep a limited, indicative color pallette that has great contrast.  I have different shades and highlights of yellow as markers animation.  Because color sometimes doesn't convey enough information, shape contrast is used.  For instance, the "diamond" shape indicates a keyframe is present on the current frame.  This is similar to programs such as After Effects and may be an affordance to some users.
