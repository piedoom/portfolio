        <h1>Hi, I'm Alexander</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Alexander Lozada and if you're reading this you're either the Google web spider, my mom, or a potential employer. In the case that you happen to be the latter, this page is meant to get us more aquainted. 
            <ol>
                <li> <strong>I'm a UI/UX designer</strong> from RIT </li>
                <li> <strong>Thats my cat, Nano.</strong>  He was very patient during this photoshoot. </li>
                <li> <strong>Design is my area of focus</strong>, but I also love making music, 3D stuff, animation, and programming. </li>
                <li> <strong>I built this website myself.</strong> </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>More about me</h2>
            <p><strong>I've been interested in the intersection between design and technology for what seems like forever.</strong>  I delved into <em>Blender 3D</em> when I was 10, and I've been learning ever since.</p>
            <p>When I got to college, my computer science roomates inspired me to <strong>learn about programming.</strong>  I currently post often to my <a href="https://github.com/piedoom">Github</a> and sometimes I'll post a tutorial on my <a href="https://vaporsoft.net">dev site</a>.  I created my portfolio page myself, and I'm pretty proud of that!
            <p>In addition to design, I really love making music.  <strong>I created the music web company <a href="https://resamplr.com">Resamplr</a> which makes high-quality sample libraries and virtual instruments.</strong></p>
