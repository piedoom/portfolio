My name is **Alexander Lozada** and if you're reading this you're either the Baidu web spider, my mom, or a potential employer.  In the case that you happen to be the latter, this page is meant to get you and I a little more aquainted.

Most people would do something like "4 truths and one lie" but I think that idea has gotten a little stale.  I thought we could switch it up and turn it into a game.  

Look at the cards below.  If you think it's true about me, swipe right,  If you think it's a lie, swipe left.

<div id="swiper"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/elm.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    var swipeDiv = document.getElementById('swiper');
    Elm.Main.embed(swipeDiv);
</script>

You might have noticied that I said "get you **and I** more aquainted.  Having scrupulus eyes, you may be wondering how *I* can get to know *you* better.  Well, how about you [send me an e-mail](mailto:alexanderpaullozada@gmail.com) and we can work something out?
